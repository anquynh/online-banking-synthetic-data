The data generation process in this study is a multi-phase, rule-based approach designed to create a synthetic dataset that mimics real online banking transactions and injects predefined fraudulent scenarios. 
The synthetic dataset simulates two years (24 consecutive months) of online banking activity for 50 users, encompassing approximately 1.5 million transaction entries. Each user is assigned a dynamic behavioral profile, including baseline income, typical transaction patterns, and seasonal fluctuations to ensure realism. The dataset structure and fraud rules are tailored to reflect the regulatory and operational standards of Vietnamese banks. Temporal ordering is preserved, and stratification by user accounts is applied for model evaluation. 

However, a notable research gap lies in the absence of a complete statistical dataset on the average monthly transaction amounts across the entire customer base. As a result, although the current dataset can capture and describe patterns of user behavior within the online banking system, it cannot provide a generalized representation of estimated figures, such as the average transfer amount for each customer segment, due to difficulties in data collection.
In future work, it is recommended to enhance the dataset by obtaining descriptive statistical data from a traditional bank and subsequently applying sampling techniques to allocate the data in a way that more accurately reflects actual consumer spending levels in Vietnam.
